# 90 Days DSA Journey with Striver (Python)

Welcome to my 90 days Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey inspired by Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet!

## About

This repository contains my daily progress, solutions, and notes as I work through the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet in Python. The goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA by consistently solving problems and learning new concepts every day.

## Structure (Until Day 1)

The repository is organized into folders based on topics and problem solved:

-   **Array/**: Array-related problems and solutions
-   **Basics/**: Python basics and introductory problems
-   **Patterns/**: Pattern problems and solutions

## How to Use

-   Browse the folders for organized code by topic.
-   Each file is named according to the problem or concept.

## Progress

-   **Day 1:** Repository initialized. Let the journey begin! Array and Basics problems solved.

## DSA Topics & Problems

Day 1 (Arrays & Patterns)

-   Largest & 2nd-largest in array
-   Remove duplicates from sorted array
-   Remove element
-   Valid anagram

_Upcomming more weeks and problems as I progress._

## LeetCode Solutions

Some problems are solved directly on LeetCode. You can find them under my profile:

-   LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/swayamyadav05/

## Next Steps

-   Continue with linked list & stack problems
-   Implement common sorting algorithms from scratch
-   Build small projects to apply DSA concepts
